The Protocol Determinator makes it easier for advocates to use data to determine a person's legal needs, and refer to available protocols or otherwise provide specific legal information.  

Our civil legal system is presumed to provide justice and fairness because it is open and uniform and provides people their day in court - an opportunity to speak and be heard.  When our courts are not open or uniform, when our courts don't hear the people they impact, lives are shaken, both in the impact of the unfair decision, like a family forced into homelessness, and the loss of faith in the foundation of our society, caused by feeling like they were treated unfairly.

Improvements in communication technology and shared knowledge and libraries can make law more open and uniform, as well as providing the ability to measure and improve.  The Protocol Determinator demonstrates both how we can both provide the best assistance we can to people who need help now while building a better system in the future.

This document walks through the steps of the Protocol Determinator, with a basic overview, and more detailed information available by clicking on the triangles.

## Selecting Specific Issues and Clones

First, we need to figure out the legal issue the user is facing.  The Protocol Determinator first tries to figure out the user's legal issue by starting at the top.  Each of these choices has it's own subsets

The interview allows you to pick the specific legal issue by selecting subsets within an issue and a "clone" issue when appropriate.  A clone issue is the same issue that has different information because of the different jurisdiction or the stage of the problem.

	<summary>How it works in docassemble</summary>
	
<br>	
When there is a reference to app.issues (which there is numerous places in the interview - in protocol matching, in the information sheet, when adding "next steps" and "options"), docassemble looks to define app.issues.  It first needs to define app.issues.there_are_any to know if it needs to start adding issues.

	---
	code: |
	  app.issues.there_are_any = True
	---

Since app.issues.there_are_any is true, docassemble looks to add an IssueObject, which is a subclass of DAObject.  When app.issues was defined, complete_attributes was set to complete, which means we can include a code block that defines app.issues[i].complete after listing attributes that need to be defined for each object.

	---
	code: |
	  app.issues[i].a_id
	  app.issues[i].no_more_preclones
	  app.issues[i].question_code_needed
	  app.issues[i].complete = True
	---


The first issue - the "Top" issue - is added automatically.  This is the issue object for all types of legal objects, with subsets like "Housing", "Family".  We can add the 'Top' issue by using the issue2aid dictionary in the LegalObjectsLibrary_dictionary.yml.

## Finding Legal Defenses

If an IssueObject involves or could involve some legal procedure like a court case, the protocol determinator will ask questions about the case using LegalObjects.

LegalObjects are similar to IssueObjects, but instead of having subsets to narrow down to a specific issue, LegalObjects have elements, like a court case has elements.  These are parts of a court case that must be proven to be successful in court.

Organizing law into elements is natural to lawyers, and also translates well to organiing information into objects for docassemble.  The protocol determinator can go down the relevant paths of the elements to find any potential defenses.

The necessary key to succes creating progammatic law is to make an interface that looks like the law to lawyers, who are going to be creating the contaent.  Adding an element or defense is much simpler thean reconfiguring a low chart or branching logic tree.

The interview determines whether LegalObjects are "met", meaning that the LegalObject is True if it helps the Plaintiff win the type of case associated with the top-level LegalObject.

First, it is checked whether there are any clones of the LegalObject.  A clone is the same legal issue with different rules because of a different jurisdiction or type of housing.

Next, it checks whether "facts", which is a list of FactObjects, is "met".  It checks this by prompting a FactObject question, and then using the response in a formula, as described in that block.

Facts are checked first for two reasons.  First, if a LegalObject has both FactObjects and other LegalObjects as elements, it means that each of the element LegalObjects require that FactObject to be a certain answer.  For example, the Corporate Plaintiff has a FactObject about whether the Plaintiff is a corporation.  If the Plaintiff is not a corporation, then the "facts" is met, and the LegalObjects shouldn't be checked.  Right now, it doesn't work this way - if the facts.ismet = False, then the legalObject is false, and it won't need to ask the other questions.  (What about the situation where a fact object might be cuz of a defense (defense that there is no notice) but if there is notice, then these other defenses should be checked.

Second, LegalObjects that are elements of a LegalObject with a FactObject may be conditioned on how that FactObject question is answered.  For example, Grounds has a FactObject of grounds_listed_in_complaint.  After asking what grounds are listed in the complaint, the LegalObjects are only relevant if the grounds listed.  So if the grounds is "Nonpayment", only the Nonpayment LegalObject will be relevant, and the Rule Violations are nto relevant (meaning they can be marked .ismet - .ismet includes not being relevant.)

So I have to make it so that if in Corporate Plaintiff, is_fictitious_name = False evaluates to True, and the legal objects are not needed and the legal object is not added to defense.  If is_fictitious_name = True, the fact formula evaluates to False and the legal objects are not needed.

In the case of Grounds, the fact_formula should always evaluate to False, so the legalObjects are always evaluated

In a "final" LegalObject, where there are no elements, then if there is a defense, facts.ismet should be False, and then the legalobject would be False.

	comment: |
	
The formula in the AirTable is called, which looks for the definition of the variables in the formula.  Is it even necessary to have the facts as children.  A sample fact_formula looks like this

	  def facts_are_met():
		if notice_exists and notice_attached_to_complaint:
		  return True
		else:
		  return False
		  
So are the variables in the fact_formula set, in this case "notice_exists" and "notice_attached_to_complaint".  If that is the case, then I can put things like that in the fact_formula and still just evaluate to True/False.  But what does True or False mean for something like Corporate_Plaintiff?  The LegalObject should be True if the Plaintiff is either not a corporation or if all the legal objects are met.  So the fact_formula should evaluate to True if the Plaintiff is not a corporation, and to False if

	  Checks to see if there are clones.  If there are, a LegalObject method is used to update the current LegalObject, by replacing any of the information fields when that information field is not blank in the clone object.
	  Because the object is updated, it can check clones again.  The clones field will always change, because the clone will not appear in the clones field.  So it checks to see if there are clones.  x.more_clones is called in the .ismet evaluation block, and if x.more_clones is not equal to "No_More_Clones", then x.more_clones gets reconsidered, forcing it to come back to this block.

Issue Objects have a field legalObjects, which is a list of Airtable ids of rows in the legalobjects tab.

[Legal Objects are in the LegalObjectLibrary base in the legalobjects tab.](https://airtable.com/shrhdjicHfPCshTR9).	

[Legal Objects use FactObjects, which are in the facts table](https://airtable.com/shrX1kOBjQeSxcJjC)

## Matching Protocols

After figuring out the IssueObject and the LegalObject, the Protocol determinator can sometimes determine if a protocol is met and a client can be referred.  Or more questions may need tob e asked.  The protocol determinator will ask needed questions and then determine the protocol.

A protocol can be created by selecting counties, issue objects and legal objects form a list.  If a protocol only applies to certain populations those questions are added as FactObjects, also used by LegalObjects.  These FactObjects are used in a formula in the Airtable to see if a protocol is met.  Using this method balances the ease of creating protocols with the flexibility needed to allow for different kinds of protocols.

	  For LegalIssues, picking a "clone" means adding a new LegalIssue to the list of legalIssues, app.issues.  This issue will be a duplicate of the first one, with fields changed as needed due to the specific factor (i.e. changing advice and elements for notice defenses in public housing).  Two fields will always be different between the original legalIssue and the clone legalIssue - the name of the clone will be removed from the x.clones attribute, and the name of the type of clone will be added to x.cloned.  So if the original legalIssue's x.clones was ['TypeOfHousing','County'], then the TypeOfHousing clone's x.clones sould be ['County'].  In addition, the clone's attribute x.cloned, which is a dictionary, has a new key:value added - the key is the name of the specific factor and the value is a set of the AirTable ids for the user's input for those factors.  For example, x.cloned['TypeOfHousing'] would be a set including the AirTable id for Public Housing.  
	  This is a set because there should be levels in these categories.  There needs to be a way to pick "Subsidized Housing", "Multifamily", and "221(d)(3)".  I haven't made the question to pick multiple levels in specific factors yet.  
	  So the first section makes sure any of the factors recorded in the x.cloned attribute is transferred to the app.specific_factors dictionary, to prevent questions from being repeated.
	  The second section adds legalObjects to app.specific_factors.  Because app.legal_objects is not a set of AirTable ids or IssueObjects, a function is needed to recursively go through the legalObjects and add them to the list if ".ismet" is not True.  In addition, if ".ismet" is not True, then the same function will run on any elements that legal issue has.  I think this is done after all the legalObjects are gathered, so I don't think it matters that this ignores FactObjects.

	comment: |
	  This is used in .match_dict, which is like a copy of protocols, except .match_dict['HCED1a']['County'] equals either true or false, while protocols['HCED1a']['County']  would be a set of AirTable ids for records in County.  This block sets the attribute .match for the Protocol (which is .match_dict['HCED1a'] to be either true or false.  Despite protocols also using Protocol, there won't be any reason why protocol['HCED1a'].match will ever be sought.
	  Tests to see if all of the factors of a Protocol are met.  .protocols is a dictionary with keys set as the names of specific protocols, like HCED2.  The values of the dictionary are sets of factors.
	  .all_true() is a function from .legal, I believe.

	  Uses a function to create .sfql or Specific Factors Question List.  This creates the list of dictionaries, with the key being an AirTable id for an item in the table with the name of the factor, and the value being the name of that item from the table.  get_sfql (which takes a key from the specific_factors dictionary, which is a name of a table like County or issues) also can add help: and default:, using values from the factor table.
	  I think I need to create ways to narrow down the specific factors that could be pulled up.  I think I will have to do that in the .py file.

	  .specific_factors is a dictionary of sets.  Each key of the dictionary is the name of a factor needed to determine if a protocol is appropriate, like "County" or "issues".  The value is a set containing AirTable ids for records in a table with the same name as the issue, so the table in the AirTable named County or issues for the earlier examples.  The .sfql

	  This section determines if each requirement in the protocol is satisfied by seeing if there is any overlap between the protocol's set of airtable ids in protocols['HCED1a']['County'] with the set of AirTable ids from the same table in specific_factors['County'].  If there is an overlap (or not disjoint), then it will set match_dict['HCED1a']['County'] to True.  A block below with then see if the all of the factors in match_dict['HCED1a'] are true.

	comment: |
	  This section runs the qualify_sentence from the Protocols table, which will look something like this:
	  
	  def qualify():
		if date_of_hearing > date_intake_completed.plus(days=3):
		  if domestic_violence or sexual_assault or stalking:
		    return 1
		  elif disability_household_member:
		    return 1
		  else:
		    return 0
		else:
		  return 0
		
	  The formula statement uses FactObject variable names and causes the interview to ask questions to define those variables.  Why does this one use "Good" or "Bad"?  That's obviously a mistake.  The next block tests to see if it is equal to 1.  So this protocol will never "qualify".

## Creating Information Sheets

After finding the user's specific legal info, the Protocol Determinator gathers the specific legal information that is most helpful from the issues and clones identified, including plain english explanations and next steps and options.

The infosheet is organized into 3 parts to give the user the "news they can use":

1. Explanations
1. Next Steps
1. Options

The first time a new issue, or a new clone of an existing issue, an advocate will be presented with legal information gathered.  The advocate can organize this information that is most understandable and create an "explanation block" for the first section.  An advocate can reorder, delete or add next steps and options.  The Protocol Determinator allows the user to save their changes to the library, so the library continues to grow and approve.

If an "explanation block" has already been created for an issue, then an information sheet can be simply reviewed and accepted, or edited if necessary.
