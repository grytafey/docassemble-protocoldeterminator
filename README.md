The Protocol Determinator makes it easier for advocates to use data to determine a person's legal needs, and refer to available protocols or otherwise provide specific legal information.

Civil common law as best, most elegant solution.

Our system is failing 

Open types of organization, with open tools for as many people as possible to participate, can provide the open, uniform law.

The Protocol Determinator demonstrates both how we can = provide the best assistance we can to people who need help now while building a better system in the future.

## Gathering Data from Pika and Elsewhere

The Protocol Determinator can be opened in Pika, and pull data from any of the tabs.  The data that is pulled from Pika can be double-checked.

## Selecting Specific Issues and Clones

The interview allows you to pick the specific legal issue by selecting subsets within an issue and a "clone" issue when appropriate.  A clone issue is the same issue that has different information because of the different jurisdiction or the stage of the problem.

The first issue - the "Top" issue - is added automatically.  This is the issue object for all types of legal objects, with subsets like "Housing", "Family".  We can add the 'Top' issue by using the issue2aid dictionary in the LegalObjectsLibrary_dictionary.yml.

Issue Objects have a field legalObjects, which is a list of Airtable ids of rows in the legalobjects tab.

Legal Objects are in the LegalObjectLibrary base in the legalobjects tab. [Here is a viewy]().

## Matching Protocols

After figuring out the IssueObject and the LegalObject, the Protocol determinator can sometimes determine if a protocol is met and a client can be referred.  Or more questions may need tob e asked.  The protocol determinator will ask needed questions and then determine the protocol.

A protocol can be created by selecting counties, issue objects and legal objects form a list.  If a protocol only applies to certain populations those questions are added as FactObjects, also used by LegalObjects.  These FactObjects are used in a formula in the Airtable to see if a protocol is met.  Using this method balances the ease of creating protocols with the flexibility needed to allow for different kinds of protocols.
